We’re putting together an open house and panel discussion at Bock Atelier on May 21st about community engagement, token distribution models and tokenised incentives.

​We will dive deep into our own use case, the establishment of a tokenised creative club were investors and creatives come together. We believe that tokenised clubs have the potential to focus on mutual growth as the core economic model. The recent controversies surrounding token launches however underscore the need for thoughtful discussion on these topics.

​Can tokens help clubs favour more equitable outcomes for members? What are good token distribution models and how do token incentives work? We invite you to join us in this exploration, to share your insights and help shape the future of how clubs operate in a tokenised world.

​If you are interested in joining the panel as a speaker, please reach out!

​
Doors open: 14.30

​Panel: 15.00 - 16.00

​Open House: 16.00 - 17.00

Thank you to our supporters:
